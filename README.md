!rank, Diamond IV (44 LP)
!highscore, My highscore is exactly 113 312 413 100!
```
**NOTE that the values are being separated by a comma `,`.**

Bobby will then respond with the following format: `@{user} {msg}` in a few milliseconds.

### Faul Language
There is a file named `bannable_words.txt` which you can fill out with words you would neve want to see in a chat room.
```
badword1
badword2
